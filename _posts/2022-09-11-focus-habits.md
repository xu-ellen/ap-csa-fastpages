### Video notes

- Instead of focusing on the outcome, use the process and learning as a focus
- Building habits and developing interest are more important than getting good grades
- Positive sources of media include podcasting, reading, exercising, and being in nature

New to my planning: Using blogging to describe and document learning process instead of solely focusing on outcome
