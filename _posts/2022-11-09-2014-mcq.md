Q6: The margin of error should be an abs value of the difference, not the raw value

Q10: The question asks for what ALWAYS results in an error. I) could work in some cases if the only element was 5.

Q12: Substring starts at 0, so the int k=1 will cause the index to be shifted by 1

Q15: II) doesn't work because the exit condition of the loop should be k<data.length-1

Q19: DeMorgan's law shows that && becomes ||. My mistake was that I distributed the ! without swapping the operator.

Q22: My answer was incorrect because Objects of subclasses can be assigned to variables of the type of superclass. This means Book can be assigned to objects of Book or Audiobook. The correct answer was B because Books cannot call a method in Audiobook

Q23: My answer was wrong because it assumed remove occurred before size was called. The correct answer doesn't change the position of "bass" because it is already in the same index.

Q28: The correct answer shows that the condition n>2 will make it so that it is true anywhere in the loop

Q30: substring starts at 0, so 3+1 index 4 is "i" not "p"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56745453/200935747-de318b02-9e83-4137-8db6-4515df112003.png)
Q31: The reference parameter doesn't make a copy of the array but makes an alias, so the values are accumulated

Q34: III) doesn't work because x and y are private instances in Point, which cannot be modified in Circle

Q36: Needs 8 not 7 in answer choices because 8%2==0

Q39: Doesn't end at return 18, but 18 becmoes the input to the higher level recurse

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56745453/200936803-d2f7ce5b-c352-4827-a57f-fdb787912d6c.png)
Q40: Returns most recent first, then moves up and prints the final

### Reflection
- Learned that .substring starts at 0, not 1
- Review DeMorgan's Law: !(p&&q) = !p||!q
- Pay attention to indices in loops
- Review recursion
