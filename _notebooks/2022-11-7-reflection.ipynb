    "This tri, I Learned about Docker, deployment through AWS, and Java classes. Most interestingly, I used Java as a backend with POJO and dynamic frontend to make more interactive components. Most of my prior experience had been with imperative programming so it was interesting to use OOP to solve problems. There were many similarities between Java and Python classes, but it is more common to use constructors in Java which instantiates the object with some default attributes, and concepts such as overloading and polymorphism."
