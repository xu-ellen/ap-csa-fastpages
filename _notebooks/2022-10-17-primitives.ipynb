    "- Definition: primitive data types are basic data types from which all others are constructed\n",
    "- 3 primitives data types used in Java are int, double, and boolean\n",
    "   - Variables declared final are constants and cannot be changed\n",
    "- Literal values are values that are written directly into the code ex. string literal\n",
    "- Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers\n",
    "   - Single operators are used to perform operations on a single value ex. unary operator\n",
    "   - Compound operators are used to perform operations on a single value and assign the result to the same variable ex. x += 5\n",
    "- Casting is the process of converting a value from one type to another\n",
    "   - Casting is done by placing the type in parentheses before the value ex. (double) x\n",
    "- Integer overflow occurs when the result of an operation is too large to be stored in the variable ie greater than 4 bytes"
