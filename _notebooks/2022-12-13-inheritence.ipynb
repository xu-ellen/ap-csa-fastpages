    "- `Inheritance`: define a base class like a car class that has methods and attributes common. For example, there can be a car steering method, gas and break method, and attributes like speed\n",
    "- `Extend`: Each car that is created will extend from this base class thus inheriting the methods and attributes defined in the base class \n",
    "    - New car classes with have special features\n",
    "- `Super Class`: Base class that has all the generic methods (base Car Class that has generic methods for all cars)\n",
    "    - `protected`: access modifier isn't affected by outside\n",
    "- `Subclass constructor`: inherits all methods and attributes from super class\n",
    "    - In car example, TeslaModelS was a subclass\n",
    "    - In personal example, IphoneX and IphoneV are subclasses \n",
    "- `super Keyword`: superclass objects - used to call superclass methods and access the constructor\n",
    "     - use constructors defined in the superclass\n",
    "     - can add specific attributes\n",
    "     - super() is the use of the keywords\n",
    "- `Overloading` a method (same name different parameters): two methods with the same name but different arguments; static polymorphism or compile time polymorphism\n",
    "- `Overriding` a method (same signature of a method): subclass has specific implementation of a method that the superclass provides\n",
    "- `Polymorphism`: doing one task in many ways through inheritance\n",
    "    - gearShift in cars can be used in two different ways in two different classes - two implementations through overriding"
