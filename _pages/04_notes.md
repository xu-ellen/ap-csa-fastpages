## Unit 1: Primitives

Primitives are built-in datatypes in Java. They are: int, long, float, double, boolean, char, byte, short. Lower case is primitive, uppercase is a wrapper class. Each time you use a wrapper class, you turn the primitive into an object which has methods you can execute (ex. String.[command]).

### Static vs Dynamic

Scanner is Java's console input.

`import java.util.Scanner;`
`Scanner input;`
`input = new Scanner(System.in);`
