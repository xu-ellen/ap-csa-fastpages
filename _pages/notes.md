## Primitives

Primitives are built-in datatypes in Java. They are: int, long, float, double, boolean, char, byte, short. Lower case is primitive, uppercase is a wrapper class. Each time you use a wrapper class, you turn the primitive into an object which has methods you can execute (ex. String.[command]).
